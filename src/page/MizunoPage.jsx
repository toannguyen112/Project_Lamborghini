  title : "GROUNDBREAKING RUNNING TECHNOLOGY",
  des : "The new Wave Tenjin 4 is the epitome of extreme technology and design dedicated to the running universe. Its Smooth-Ride sole converts weight into thrust, reducing the load on the joints. A blend of rubber and carbon fibre on the X10 sole maximises stability and automatically regulates to achieve the right degree of rigidity. Designed with a new outsole providing outstanding grip even on wet surfaces. Breathability and pure energy come into their own with the vamp design inspired by the iconic Y shape, symbolising the headlamps of the Supercars from Santâ€™Agata.
